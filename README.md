# War Peer Programming Exercise

1. Create player objects with distinct names and a way to track their individual hand/deck.
2. At the start of each game, initialize a deck of 52 cards in a random order (e.g. using random.shuffle).
3. Once initialized, split deck evenly and assign each part to a player object.
4. Design a battle mechanic.
5. Design a war mechanic.
6. Track the ongoing game state between each turn/battle/war.
7. Design a win condition/game state.
8. Design a user interface for proceeding through turns -- potentially just visualizing turn's battle/war and requiring user input before proceeding to next turn.
9. Implement an end of game procedure where a winner is announced and program closes or prompts user(s) to play again.
